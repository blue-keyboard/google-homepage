# Recreating Google Homepage

In this project ill try to recreate the only the visual elements of the google homepage, without the functionality.
I couldn't resist to try to mimic the page as much as possible though.


## Mini-header at top-left

I tried to recreate it with pure css, made a 3x3 grid for the google apps icon and a rounded div for the profile icon, i realized in this part that sometimes is really tricky to center things, especially vertically, so I had to use some padding in pixels in some parts to align the items manually.

Also added the hover efects to the links and the 3x3 icon.


## Footer nav-bar

Seemed simple, tried to match the exact grey tones just for fun, discovered that line-height comes in handy for spacing top and bottom when only text.


## Main content

For this part I experimented with a simple div-wrapper that has text-align to center its items, so i made its childs inline-block elements and to put one below the other i just used the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag.

The most interesting part was doing the search box, for this I made a div flexbox with rounded corners, then the "search icon" and the input-text as its childs, i learned how to style the input-text removing some of the properties that has as default.


# Google search results

Feeling confident to do this page as well, it will just take more time, gonna try to mimic as much as possible as well. I know is not necessary but i feel i can learn some things too focusing on the detail, challenging myself.

## 3 part Header

This took time becouse had to figure it out some things for myself, I think the most important part was to discover how valuable are the developer tools and felt I gained more skill with it, could borrow the vsg items thanks to it.

Also felt that I hard coded many things to align things etc, i don't know if this is more common than i think, or could be that i am using only plain css. Also i think my css code could be more compact (basically same result with less code) and organized, probably will try to educate myself in this subject.

## Main content - search results

This was relatively easy but the addition of some details to make it look like the real page took some time. For example finding and aligning some svg files, the star rating, but overall easy.

## o-pages and aside

Making the Goooooogle part was a bit challenging, in part becouse I had to make an image and chop the letters into different images with the same height so i culd align them properly, had a problem where just by having an anchor tag around the o's would push those a bit to the top, but could solve it.

I thought the aside would be the most difficult part, but i think as i was doing this project i got better at css and could in some way predict what would be the appropiate layout and how to style it, a lot of flexbox in this part.
