## Recreating Google Homepage

In this project ill try to recreate the only the visual elements of the google homepage, without the functionality.

# Mini-header at top-left

I tried to recreate it with pure css, made a 3x3 grid for the google apps icon and a rounded div for the profile icon, i realized in this part that sometimes is really tricky to center things, especially vertically, so I had to use some padding in pixels in some parts to align the items manually.

Also added the hover efects to the links and the 3x3 icon.

# Footer nav-bar

Seemed simple, tried to match the exact grey tones just for fun, discovered that line-height comes in handy for spacing top and bottom when only text.
